You are not allowed to use any other placeholders. You can use them multiple times in the answer but you can't use any other words that could be used to identify me.\nRemember that my surname is not a cuisine name.\nDon't make things up, be truthful and respond only based on the context.\nExample:\nMy name is %imie% %nazwisko% I am from %miasto% and I am a %zawod%.\nGood luck!.\n",
